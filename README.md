This repository is source code of the examples for the paper: 
> [An Introduction to WebAssembly for JavaScript Developers](https://pascalpares.github.io/webassembly)

All the examples are tested using Node.js release **v14.16.0**. These examples can be easily adapted to run on a Web Browser.

You will find for each example:
- the JavaScript code, 
- the bytecode of the Web Assembly module,
- as well as the source code of the Web Assembly module in *WAT* syntax, which is the textual representation of the bytecode.
